{"name":"PolyDist","tagline":"","body":"WARNING! MEN AT WORK!\r\nPlease excuse this webpage while it is being created.\r\n\r\n### Welcome to PolyDist!\r\nPolyDist is a Python 3 code, aimed at engineers and physicists. It allows the user to define a point and a polygonal field in a 2D Cartesian Coordinate system, rotate a ray around that point every _x_ degrees, and then return the distances from the point to the intersection of its rays.\r\nGraphing and exporting distances is also supported.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have a point (2,3) and a polygonal field with vertices at [(4,4), (7,4), (8,7), (6,5), (5,6), (3,5)], and you want to calculate the distances from (2,3) to the intersection of a ray with the field perimeter every 10 degrees, you would call the function like this:\r\npython3 PolyDist.py\r\nMain point coordinates: (2,3)\r\nVertices coordinates: [(4,4), (7,4), (8,7), (6,5), (5,6), (3,5)]\r\nAngle of rotation: 10\r\n\r\nIf desired, you can then export the distances to an .xlsx spreadsheet, and/or show the graph in a new window: ![show the graph in a new window](https://imgur.com/DEwNxgU)\r\n\r\n\r\n### History\r\nPolyDist started out as a Matlab (R) project in summer 2014. After writing the code in Matlab, I forked it into the Python 3 language a year later. The original Matlab code is still being maintained by another contributor. Several features of the Matlab code are making their way into PolyDist, along with some exciting innovations of our own!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributorâ€™s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with PolyDist? Contact me via [email](https://github.com/Fred-Barclay/PolyDist/blob/master/README.md) and I'll help you figure it out! GPG/PGP signing/encryption is preferred but not required. \r\n\r\nDiscovered a bug or limitation? Unsure about something? Then hop on over to our [Issues page](https://github.com/Fred-Barclay/PolyDist/issues) and let me know!\r\n\r\nIf you think that a feature or bug squash needs to be implemented, and you can code it yourself, please open a pull request. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
