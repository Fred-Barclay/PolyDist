# PolyDist
Repo for PolyDist code.

PolyDist is a distance-finding Python 3 program. PolyDist_README.txt contains the specific info.

I have signed PolyDist.py, sha256sums, and sha512sums files with PGP. The public key is available at:
[pgp.mit.edu] (https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x7338CE369A928102),
keys.gnupg.net (*temporarily unavailable*),
and [pool.sks-keyservers.net] (https://keyserver.mattrude.com/search/vindex/0x7338CE369A928102).
**UPDATE**
GitHub now supports integrated GPG-signing. Testing in progress...

Fingerprint is 9A928102; email is BugsAteFred@gmail.com.
PGP/GPG signed and encrypted communication is preferred but not required.

There may be occasional discrepancies as I commit new revisions before updating the signatures/checksums, or vice versa. Wait 15 minutes and if the discrepancies still exist, please contact me ASAP.
