PolyDist is a distance-finding Python 3 program that aims to make 2-dimensional
linear/polygonal distance calculations easier. Originally developed for
radiation therapy, it is useful for all sorts of situations in which the
distances from a specific point to the perimeters of a polygon are needed.  
More details can be found in README or on the website.

I have signed all the files with GPG. The public key is available at:  
[pgp.mit.edu](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x7338CE369A928102),  
keys.gnupg.net (*temporarily unavailable*),  
and
[pool.sks-keyservers.net](https://keyserver.mattrude.com/search/vindex/0x7338CE369A928102).

Additionally, all of my commits are signed with my GPG key. While this is not
as secure as detached signatures, it gives an additional level of verification.

Fingerprint is 9A928102; email is BugsAteFred@gmail.com.
PGP/GPG signed and encrypted communication is preferred but not required.

There may be occasional discrepancies as I commit new revisions before updating the signatures/checksums, or vice versa. Wait 15 minutes and if the discrepancies still exist, please contact me ASAP.
